# Stellar Asset Issuance

This is an example of how to issue a new asset in Stellar Network, just follow the instructions below:

## Functions
At this point, the project is incomplete, and is intended for you to try to complete the functions folder to get the asset issuance work.
Go to functions folder, then complete each of the js files there. After that, you can continue with instructions

1. Copy .env.example into a .env
2. Go to [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test) and create 2 accounts, copy their public and secret keys to .env for Issuer and Distributor
3. Fund those accounts using Stellar Friendbot

At this point, you can run `npm start` to interact with the CLI prepared for this example.

To show how it works, run the scripts in the following order:

1. Trust issuer (Distributor)
2. Generate tokens (Issuer)
3. Limit supply (Issuer)
4. Publish ICO OFfer (Distributor)
